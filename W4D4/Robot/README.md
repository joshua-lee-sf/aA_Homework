# RSpec Robot Demo

To download this demo, click on the `Download Project` button at the bottom of
this page. On the ensuing GitHub page, click the green `<> Code` button and
select `Download ZIP`. Move the downloaded __.zip__ file to your desired folder
and unzip.

The demo consists of a Ruby file, __lib/robot.rb__, and the associated RSpec
tests (__spec/robot_spec.rb__). The code in __robot.rb__ is already complete. To
run the tests--everything should pass!--run `rspec` in the project's root
directory. Your task is simply to look through the code--particularly the
__spec__ file--and make sure you understand how all of the tests work.
